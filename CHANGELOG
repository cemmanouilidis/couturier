Known issues:
  What's not working yet:
  - Translation Package is not deployed through generated source-tarball

  - commandline args are ignored. This should be changed, to allow nautilus to 
    start couturier and pass pdf and/or image files.

  - allow multiple selection (MS) of documents which are in the "to-be-combined-list".
    MS whould allow to delete more than just one document from the list.
  
  - delete button does not work for selected items

  - changes gnome-open calls to xdg-open (for KDE/XFCE users)
  
  - Loading/Importing of encrypted pdf documents are not possible.

  - Warn if the output file (the combined one) has the same name is one of the files
    in the "to-be-combined-list".
